###
### This file should be stored in $PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts
### If $PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts doesn't exist, you can make one with the following:
###    PS> New-Item $PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts -ItemType File -Force
### This will create the file and the containing subdirectory if it doesn't already

### As a reminder, to enable unsigned script execution of local scripts on client Windows, 
### you need to run this line (or similar) from an elevated PowerShell prompt:
###   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
### This is the default policy on Windows Server 2012 R2 and above for server Windows. For 
### more information about execution policies, run Get-Help about_Execution_Policies.
